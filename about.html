				<p>
					I am a one man, old school, operation who can prep and fire about 12-16 samples
					in a 12 hour day. My business is designed to help the small miner who may not
					have the minimal number of samples or the budget to work a larger commercial
					lab. I typically fire up my furnace on Tuesday and Friday. This allows a few
					days for small orders to accumulate in the lab so they can all be processed at
					one time to be profitable and make the best use of my time and equipment.
					However, if you have a lot of samples that need to be run quickly I will work 5
					days a week to get your results.

				<h3>Education and Training</h3>
				<p>
					I am Penn State educated but didn't really find my niche until I moved to
					Colorado to join a fledgling mining company in 1979. I was fortunate to be taken
					under the wing of 4 old masters who taught me everything they still remembered
					about geology, mining, milling, fire assaying, AAS, and chemical extraction.
					Under their guidance, I was allowed to help build a proprietary lab and prefect
					a technique for processing gold from telluride ores with a 98% recovery rate. I
					have worked in three commercial labs as an assayer and AA tech since my early
					days with my mentors, one proprietary lab, and as the in-house assayer for two
					mining companies.
				</p>
				<br />
				<h3>My Lab</h3>
				<p>
					I moved my assay equipment into my own building and offered my services to the
					general public in 2012. I have done work for about 300 clients from all over the
					western United States, Canada, Mexico, South America and Liberia and have a lot
					of satisfied repeat clients, and enjoy meeting and working with the folks in our
					field.
				</p>
				<p>
					If I can help you, please don't hesitate to drop an email or give me a call. I
					answer all inquiries.
